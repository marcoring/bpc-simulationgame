          "The game is aimed at teaching Business Process Change (BPC) in the context of the digital transformation on the example of a bike manufacturing company. It is designed to be played in teams. The game consists of six rounds, during which the players make various decisions in up to ten process steps: Purchasing, Logistics, Frame Preparation, Sensor Preparation, Battery Preparation, Engine Preparation, Bike Construction, Application Development, Quality Assurance, and Sales. The decisions are different in every round. More details on each round can be read in the corresponding section. If you have any questions regarding the particular input field, just hover the mouse over the questionmark next to it. This will give you an explanation of the field's purpose. The goal of the game is to design the production and sales of the IoT bikes in a way that it is possible to earn more than the other teams. After each round, the profit for each team will be calculated. The team with the highest profit at the end of the sixth round is the winner." +
          "In order to save the data for each process step, the player has to click the 'Confirm' button at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise, the data WILL NOT be saved. However, the impact of the entered data on the budget, running cost, and production capacity will be visible in the lower cost accounting section. This should help the players with their decision making. The upper part of the screen displays the latest data. Clicking on the button in the top right corner will return the player to the main screen." +
          "Be careful when choosing the 'Safety' parameter in the different production steps. If this parameter is too low, the number of defective bikes could be tremendous, which makes it impossible to sell many bikes despite of all the efforts. A parameter that can influence the sales numbers is the quality of a bicycle. However, all process steps have a different influence on the final product quality, depending on the round that is being played. Listen carefully to the information in the introduction to the round, this might give you some hints which steps are more important than others." +
          "After all necessary data has been submitted, do not forget to click the 'End round' button in the top right corner of the main screen. Be careful - changes will be IMPOSSIBLE after clicking this button. This will notify the teacher that a team is ready and allow him to start the simulation. The player will be notified about the simulation results. After that, he or she will be able to view the statistics of the simulated round, the revenue and the sales numbers of all competing teams, and the game will be unlocked for the input of data for the next round.",
